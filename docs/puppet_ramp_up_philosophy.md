# Puppet ramp up philosophy

This repository and documentation is aimed at providing you with a quick path to value with your PE installation.  When looking at other materials on the internet they will start by teaching you the details of different components of PE and then leave you wondering how you fit those components together.  The documentation here will show you a best practice approach to using PE without a lot of the details with the goal of providing a path to gaining value with PE early and learning the details later.  

## What to expect

Expect it to be difficult at first.  We're going to dive into the deep end and figure out how to get some actual work done.  Once you have the basics down you'll want to accomplish something more difficult and you may need to look at the official documentation or outward to the internet but you'll have an anchor point that you can work from and start to understand how the documentation you're reading relates to the workflow you'll learn here.
