# Git Learning

There are lots of ways to learn git, here are some suggestions.  If you want to read about git and/or watch some videos start in the non-interactive section.  If you prefer to play with actual commands to learn then start in the interactive section.

# Different Learning Options

## Interactive:
The first two start out in the web browser then git immersion helps you setup git on your machine and walk through examples on your actual machine.

My favorite web tool for being able to mentally visualize what happens when you run different git commands.

## Git Tools and UIs:

### GitUp
If you have a Mac you can run GitUp which provides a visual representation of your repository as well as quick ways to do some more complicated command line commands.

### SourceTree:
SourceTree has the advantage of working on windows and Mac.  You have to make an Atlassian account to use it for free past 30 days but it is free.

### GitKraken:
This looks like it will be a nice free tool, but Iâ€™m waiting on an invite.
